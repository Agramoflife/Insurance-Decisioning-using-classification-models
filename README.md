## Prudential Life Insurance Risk Prediction Model

**Welcome!** This repository holds the code and data behind a project to develop a machine learning model for predicting life insurance application risk at Prudential. Our goal is to create a more automated and efficient application process while maintaining accuracy and privacy.

### Problem Statement

- Traditional life insurance application processes are lengthy and cumbersome, leading to low adoption rates.
- Prudential seeks to streamline the process by predicting risk automatically using a machine learning model.

### Model Purpose

This model aims to:

- **Predict** the outcome of life insurance applications (approved or rejected) with high accuracy.
- **Explain** the rationale behind each prediction, promoting transparency and building trust with customers.

### Features

The model uses various features extracted from life insurance applications, including:

- **Demographic information:** Age, gender, location, etc.
- **Health data:** Medical history, prescription drugs, lifestyle habits, etc.
- **Financial data:** Income, assets, debts, etc.
- **Behavioral data:** Application completion time, responses to specific questions, etc.

### Datasets

This repository contains multiple datasets related to life insurance applications:

- **Training data:** Used to train the model.
- **Validation data:** Used to evaluate and fine-tune the model.
- **Testing data:** Used to assess the final performance of the model on unseen data.

### Technology Stack

The project utilizes various technologies, including:

- Programming languages: Python
- Machine learning libraries: Scikit-learn, XGBoost, TensorFlow (optional)
- Data analysis libraries: Pandas, NumPy
- Visualization libraries: Matplotlib, Seaborn

### Getting Started

To run the code and explore the model:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Set up the environment and data paths according to the instructions in the `README_environment.md` file.
4. Run the Jupyter notebook files for data exploration, model training, and evaluation.
